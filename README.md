# Buddy By Daylight


This project is a standalone companion application meant to support current or prospective Dead By Daylight players. 
This app will allow a user to create an account as well as manage it. You will be able to review information about current killers and survivors as well as popular content within the Dead By Daylight community.

This application is my capstone project and is meant to simply be an assignment. This product was not created with the intent of it being released (yet).
